    - You MUST output the update analysis and the actual update commands in the end of the next reply
    - 'The update commands MUST strictly follow the **JSON Patch (RFC 6902)** standard; but can only use the following operations: `replace`, `add` (only used to insert new items into an object or array), `remove`; that is, the output must be a valid JSON array containing operation objects'
